### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt how to really use the grid display property

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<main>Some HTML code I'm proud of</main>
```
```css
#one{grid-area: header;}
    #two{grid-area: center;}
    #three{grid-area: left;}
    #four{grid-area: footer;}
    #five{grid-area: right;}

    main{
        display: grid;
        grid-template-areas: 
        'header header header header header center center right'
        'header header header header header center center right'
        'left footer footer footer footer footer footer right'
        'left footer footer footer footer footer footer right'
        ;
        grid-gap: 0 20px;
        width: 95%;
        margin:  auto ;
        padding: 50px 0;
        height: 100px;
    }
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
